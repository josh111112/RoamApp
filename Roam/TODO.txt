TODO:
    done - turn viewmodels into environment objects
    done - implement firebase
    done - get accurate location data
    done - create listener + stopListening functions
    done - add appDelegate code to RoamApp.swift
    done - fix time issue -- look at hw6 code
    done - figure out what needs the @MainActor tag to make sure we are updating the UI on the main thread
    done - add firebase helper
    done - use async await for the fetch locations on google places api
    implemet feature so when history item is pressed it opens up and fills screen more, displaying more data
    update firebase permission to auth only
    store image data in cache so that we dont have to retrieve from firebase or api when needed





App ideas that still need to be implemented:
    Home View:
        update the UI so that something is going on in the main part of the screen, currently is empty
    Memory View:
        implement a filter:
            card view most recent - oldest
            nearest - furthest
            most unique (furthest away from all other entries or if starred)
            if starred, show the star icon
            would need to add stars to the data cards
